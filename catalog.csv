Until recently, most of these have been microorganisms, but technological and computational progress has made it progressively easier and cheaper to sequence the genomes of higher organisms. This field may have more of an impact on your future lives than almost any other field of the life sciences - mostly because it touches on all areas of study. The course will focus on the impact that genomes will have in selected areas. It will begin with a basic understanding of the science and technology that gave rise to our current capabilities in sequencing and the fact that technology continues to provide greater capacity and cheaper prices. You will soon see that every field in the College of Science is well represented in the science and technology. We will then go on to see how genomics influences many topics that affect our daily lives and can possibly provide answers to some critical questions (or at least pose better questions): What is the basis of personalized medicine? What does genomics tell us about the genealogy of mankind? What impact will genomics have on our future food supply and our ability to feed a population of 9 billion people? What is the human microbiome and what does that mean to me? Similarly, what is the gut microbiome, the mouthmicrobiome, etc? What impact will genomics have on the development of alternative energy sources, especially biofuels?

We do this within a context of institutions - formal rules and informal norms that shape our incentives. The outcomes that emerge, and the value we create in the process, depends on those institutions and incentives. Economics is a broad and diverse body of ideas that helps us understand those everyday choices and the kinds of outcomes they generate. We will explore these economic ideas and the ways that institutions affect outcomes, from informal social norms all the way to big questions of social organization such as the contrast between capitalism and socialism. Our main method of exploring economic ideas will be communicating those ideas - through writing, video, and other multimedia approaches; we will build and deepen our understanding of economic ideas in society by explaining them, applying"

Landscape ecology focuses on the important relationships of landscape structure (pattern, heterogeneity) and ecological processes (movement of animals, hydrologic dynamics) and how this information is used for natural resource management. Biogeography examines ecological patterns and processes at larger scales (generally at subcontinental to global) for the purposes of managing plants and animals of global importance. In the last 15 years, tremendous efforts have been made to create spatial databases that help support research and management of natural resources at various scales. The lab will focus on the use and application of these databases that are common in natural resource management settings."

6320,PHIL 56100,PHIL,56100,Reading Philosophy: Skills And Strategies,"Academic philosophy demands both the ability to read large amounts of texts fluently and the ability to read texts carefully and closely. Furthermore, the abstract nature of philosophical discourse places a large cognitive demand upon readers. This course prepares philosophy students for these intensive reading demands. The course has three major learning areas: (1) the language skills that students need to read fluently (i.e., the efficient processing of language for general comprehension of meaning); (2) reading strategies that students can use to improve comprehension and learning; and (3) communication about readings, as the close reading of texts is essential to communicating one's ideas both orally and in writing. Permission of department required."

On the other hand, writing is also a means by which ideas are developed, clarified, and come to be understood by the writer. In other words, writing is not just a tool of communication but it is also a tool that can be used for learning. Focusing on both purposes of writing, this course aims to develop the ability of students to use writing as a means of learning and developing ideas as well as communicating ideas, particularly through expository-based writing assignments. Students will also learn writing processes that will aid their ability to effectively compose in English, including outlining, drafting, and editing. Permission of department required."
6324,PHIL 57200,PHIL,57200,Writing To Argue,"Writing is a primary mode of communication in philosophy, perhaps the primary mode. This course aims to prepare students for the writing demands of philosophy by having students develop their ability to analyze, interpret, and critique philosophical arguments through written works and, in the process, construct their own philosophical arguments. Students will also learn writing processes that will aid their ability to effectively and clearly compose philosophical arguments, including outlining, drafting, and editing. Finally, the class will also pay attention to genre and rhetorical features of philosophical discourse, such as how philosophers enact criticism and write introductions to research papers. Students can use their course paper as a draft of a writing sample for PhD programs."

Thus, this course focuses on how China has managed the challenges of globalization. China is a particularly useful case study because it failed the challenges of globalization in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. For an ancient civilization such as China, this failure had tremendous impact on its national pride. The Chinese refer to this historical juncture as the ""century of shame."" Towards the end of the 20th century and the onset of the 21st, China faced again the challenges of globalization and has arisen to the tasks in a spectacular fashion, transforming a largely rural and agriculture economy into the world's second largest economic power.

Genetics has come to be an important aspect of research in almost every field of Neuroscience and Psychology ranging from neural development to cognitive function and dysfunction. However, many students have not had the opportunity to explore this in their studies to date. Therefore, the goal of this course is to provide students with the background needed to understand and think critically about the genetic components of Neuroscience and behavioral research. Numerous questions will be explored mainly through discussion of research papers. Lectures by the professor will fill in background knowledge needed to understand the readings. The questions explored will include: What are chromosomes and genes? What do they do? How do they do it? How do genes control development of the brain? How are single genes manipulated in animals to study their effects on behavior? How can genes associated with normal or abnormal behavior be identified? What has been learned from gene-behavior studies in animals? in humans? What do these studies tell us about the nature-nurture controversy? In addition to exploring these more traditional aspects of behavioral genetics we will address the 3 most exciting recent developments. These include the use of transgenic primate models, selective remote control of specific neural circuits using optogenetics and chemogenetics, and epigenetics, which helps explain how environmental factors and behavior itself can change gene activity and how these changes may be transmitted from one generation to the next. Many behaviors could be used to explore the principles these questions address. The readings will be selected from papers that focus on learning & memory and mental illness. However, if students are interested in other behaviors, papers that involve those behaviors and serve our purposes can be substituted. Grading will be based mainly on informal presentations of papers and participation in discussions of these papers. Permission of department required."
